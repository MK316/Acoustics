    ### ðŸ“Œ What is Quantal Theory?
    Quantal Theory, proposed by **Kenneth N. Stevens (1972, 1989)**, explains how **speech sounds are produced efficiently and remain stable** despite variability in articulation.
    
    According to this theory:
    1. **Speech articulation and acoustics have a nonlinear relationship**:
       - Small movements in the tongue, lips, or jaw **may not** cause large changes in sound.
       - However, at certain articulatory positions, **small shifts can lead to sudden and significant acoustic changes** (quantal changes).
    2. **Some articulatory regions are stable**, meaning they allow for small adjustments without drastically altering the sound.
    3. **Quantal sounds** (like /i/, /u/, /a/, /p/, /t/, /k/) are common across languages because they maximize stability and clarity.

    ### ðŸ“Œ Why Is This Important?
    âœ… **Explains why certain sounds are universal** in human languages.  
    âœ… **Shows how speech remains stable** despite variability in articulation.  
    âœ… **Helps in phonetics, linguistics, and speech synthesis**.

    ## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
    - **Quantal Theory explains why speech sounds remain stable** even with minor articulatory variations.
    - Some articulatory positions are **stable zones**, while others cause **quantal shifts** in acoustics.
    - This helps us understand **phonetic universals and efficient speech production**.
